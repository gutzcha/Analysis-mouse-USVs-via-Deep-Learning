# HybridMouse: A hybrid CNN-BiLSTM model for mouse ultrasonic vocalizations extraction


The main problem of any supervised deep learning method is to obtain labeled data to use in training.
Fortunately, my team and I labeled hundreds of hours of recordings of vocal communications between mice.
These recording were from three different mouse strains in various ages and social states.
The labeled data was then used to create a deep learning hybrid CNN-LSTM model to extract USVs from audio recordings.
The model was integrated into a user-friendly GUI that allows manual as well as automatic labeling of USVs, 
and provides an easy way to browse and analyze USVs that outperform other models.
