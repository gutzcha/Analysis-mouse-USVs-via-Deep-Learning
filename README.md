A deep learning tool to extract mouse vocalizations from audio clips using CNN

The main problme of any supervised deep learning methods is to obtain labeled data to use in training. In the course of my masters degree me and my team labeled houndreds of hours of recordingd of vocal communications between mice from three different strains in a veraiery of ages, and social states.

I have decied to create this tool for two main reasons:
1: To create a tool that will help advance the scientific knowladge by providing a helpfull tool to easily extract calls from   recording
2: To better my own knowldge of Deep learning tools and practice

If this project helps even one person, It will be worth it and considered a successful one
